The task is to implement a
syntax analyser (SA) for this language using a recursive descent parser. The analyser’s sole function is make sure a
user’s source program is syntactically correct, and the SA should generate appropriate and helpful error messages
where required. The SA should terminate on encountering and reporting the first error. The structure of the language is like Ada.
